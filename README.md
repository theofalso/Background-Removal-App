This code is just an interface to implement a model that isn't mine. This is the model:
Model: ZhengPeng7/BiRefNet in Hugging Face

Clone this repository or download the files.
Install the dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

How to Use:
Place the images you want to process in the input folder.
Run the application:
python app.py

Wait for the model to load (the first time it will download, which may take some time).
Press the "Start Processing" button.
Collect your background-removing images from the output folder.
